## Prerequisites

this standalone needs a database system to run.

PostgreSQL was used in development but everyone can change database system modifying Provider class (src/databaseINIT/Provider).

PostgreSql can be downloaded here 

https://www.postgresql.org/download/

You have to create you're own database and connect it on you're IDE.
After you've done it, you can run DBinit.sql (src/databaseINIT/DBinit.sql) and it will create schemas on this database automatically.

You can test this standalone using running main function in src/testing/TestRunner. 
JUnit JARs can be downloaded here
